 The Social Style Theory is a model that classifies observable behavior patterns into four primary social styles.
 This theory is often used in the context of interpersonal communication and is aimed at helping people understand and improve their communication skills
 by recognizing their own and others' preferred communication styles.
 While there are different versions of the Social Style Theory, the most widely known and used model identifies four social styles:


-personality is a big part of emotional quotient(EQ)

The first step to improve EQ is to know one’s personality.
There are many ways to measure personality,

1)Extravert or Introvert (المنفتح و الانطوائي):
	 where do we get Energy: What energizes me most-Interacting with other people or being by myself?

2)Sensor or Intuitive (الاستشعار أم الحدس):
	 how people perceive : The Forest or the Trees? Do I usually pay more attention to the facts and details 
	 or do I try to understand the connections, underlying meaning, and implications?

3)Thinker or feeler (المفكر أو المحسوس):
	 How people make Decision : Do I make decisions more objectively, weighing the pros and cons, 
	 or based on how I feel about the issue, and how I and others will be affected by it?

4)Judger or Perceiver (القاضي أو المُدرِك) :
	 describes the very different ways people like to organize their world, and how they like to live their lives:
	 Do I tend to make most decisions quickly and easily or does making decisions often make me anxious and unsure?
	 Would I rather have things settled and decided or be able to leave my options open, just in case something unexpected comes up?

=> we will execlude no 2 and 4 as for both of these are related to our decision making process.

-so now we have a matrix of 2 * 2 including the extravert or introvert along with thinker or feeler.

  The "Driver" personality style, as defined in the Social Style Theory, is associated with certain behavioral traits and characteristics.
  Here is an image or description of the typical traits associated with the Driver personality:

Driver Personality Traits:

Direct and Decisive: Drivers are known for their direct and decisive approach to tasks and decision-making. They are focused on achieving results and are not afraid to take charge.

It's important to note that while the Driver personality has these characteristics, individuals are unique, and not everyone with a Driver style will exhibit all of these traits.
 The Social Style Theory acknowledges that people may display a mix of characteristics from different styles depending on the situation.
 Additionally, this theory is a tool for understanding communication styles and preferences rather than a strict classification of personality traits.
